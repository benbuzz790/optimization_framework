# Optimization Framework - Core Dependencies
# Designed for ARM64 Windows compatibility without scipy
# Core Python standard library dependencies (no external packages needed)
# The framework is designed to use only built-in Python modules for maximum compatibility
# Optional: For enhanced random number generation (pure Python)
# random2>=1.0.1
# Optional: For better performance profiling (pure Python)  
# cProfile (built-in)
# Note: This framework intentionally uses only Python standard library
# to ensure compatibility with ARM64 Windows where scipy compilation fails.
# All optimization algorithms are implemented from scratch using:
# - math (built-in)
# - random (built-in) 
# - typing (built-in for Python 3.5+)
# - abc (built-in)
# - traceback (built-in)
# - copy (built-in)
# - collections (built-in)
