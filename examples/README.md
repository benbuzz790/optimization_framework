## üîß How to Run Examples

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Optimization framework installed (see main README.md)
- No additional dependencies required

### Running Examples
```bash
# From the project root directory
cd examples

# Run basic example
python basic_optimization.py

# Run constrained example  
python constrained_optimization.py

# Run portfolio example
python portfolio_optimization.py
```

## üéØ When to Use Each Optimizer

### Greedy Search Solver
- **Best for**: Simple problems, local optimization, quick solutions
- **Problem types**: Continuous variables, smooth objectives
- **Configuration**: Adjust `step_size` and `max_iterations`
- **Example usage**: See `basic_optimization.py`

### Genetic Algorithm Solver  
- **Best for**: Complex landscapes, discrete variables, global optimization
- **Problem types**: Mixed variables, combinatorial problems, multi-modal functions
- **Configuration**: Tune `population_size`, `generations`, `mutation_rate`
- **Example usage**: See `constrained_optimization.py` and `portfolio_optimization.py`

### Simulated Annealing Solver
- **Best for**: Escaping local optima, noisy objectives, exploration-heavy problems
- **Problem types**: Discrete optimization, complex constraints, large search spaces
- **Configuration**: Set `initial_temperature`, `cooling_rate`, `max_iterations`
- **Example usage**: See `constrained_optimization.py`

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Errors**
```python
# If you get import errors, ensure the framework is installed:
pip install -e .  # From project root
```

**Constraint Violations**
```python
# Check constraint setup in your problem:
problem = Problem(objective, constraints=[constraint], variables=[x, y])
solution = solver.solve(problem)
print(solution.get_best_solution()['constraint_violations'])
```

**Poor Convergence**
```python
# Try different algorithm configurations:
# For Genetic Algorithm - increase population or generations
solver = GeneticAlgorithmSolver({'population_size': 50, 'generations': 100})

# For Simulated Annealing - adjust temperature schedule  
solver = SimulatedAnnealingSolver({'initial_temperature': 100, 'cooling_rate': 0.95})
```

**Variable Bounds Issues**
```python
# Ensure bounds are properly defined:
x = ContinuousVariable("x", bounds=(-10, 10))  # Both bounds required
y = IntegerVariable("y", bounds=(0, 100))      # Integer bounds
z = BinaryVariable("z")                        # No bounds needed
```

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### For Large Problems
- Use Genetic Algorithm with smaller populations initially
- Implement early stopping based on convergence
- Consider constraint penalty methods for heavily constrained problems

### For Real-Time Applications  
- Start with Greedy Search for quick approximate solutions
- Use warm starts with good initial guesses
- Limit iterations based on time constraints

### Memory Management
- Monitor solution history size for long optimizations
- Use solution tracking selectively for large problems
- Clear intermediate results when not needed
